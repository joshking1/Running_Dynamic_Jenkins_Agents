# It is essential to get rid of static agents. 

# However, it would help if you also remembered that it is impossible to eliminate all the static agents. 

# For instance, you cannot containerize the MacOs operation system and many more. 

# Running dynamic agents makes the security teams happy, and they highly recommend it. 

# It means you do not have VM instances to maintain. 

# This means you are not making static infrastructure costing the company money leading to wasteful resources because even when you are not using static Jenkins agents, they are still running. 

# Using dynamic agents provisioned as pods by the cluster help one to create a ROBUST, SCALABLE, EFFECTIVE, EFFICIENT & SECURE CI/CD pipeline.
